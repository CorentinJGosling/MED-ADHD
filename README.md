# European ADHD Guidelines Group RCT Dataset Curated at Southampton University (MED-EAGG)

## Description of the database

The MED-EAGG project is a database of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in children and adults exploring the efficacy/safety of pharmacological interventions for people with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The collection of the data from these RCTS has been performed within the context of a network-meta-analysis [https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpsy/article/PIIS2215-0366(18)30269-4/fulltext] led by Prof Samuele Cortese (University of Southampton), on the behalf of the European ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG).

## Do you wish to conduct a project using the MED-EAGG dataset? Follow these steps:

1. Carefully check that the goal of your project does not overlap with a project that has already been submitted by another team (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxnPo9E77LrsMqH3C6ANb3AoaNmDu5NV76WvtY-a0g/edit#gid=0[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxnPo9E77LrsMqH3C6ANb3AoaNmDu5NV76WvtY-a0g/edit#gid=0]). If so, feel free to contact them to propose your help.
2. Read the data dictionary below and record all the variables of interest.
3. Fullfill a proposal form, which includes a description of the projet, a list of variables you would need, as well as a description of the members of your team (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOku8vVWqndY_6WZ8H2lqbftxBq0EwXcwUWxggRO6ac0RIMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOku8vVWqndY_6WZ8H2lqbftxBq0EwXcwUWxggRO6ac0RIMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link]).
4. Wait for the approval of your request by the executive committee.
5. Once approved, you will receive the dataset by encrypted e-mail. You will need a Proton email account to obtain it (https://proton.me/fr/mail[https://proton.me/fr/mail]).
6. Analyze the dataset and send us the manuscript describing the results.
7. Publish the manuscript (note that the code used to analyze the data **MUST** be publicly shared, **but that the raw data cannot be shared**).
8. Delete both the dataset we sent you, and the email in your ProtonMail mailbox.

## Credits

Each publication using this database should list the key members that contributed to the creation of the MED-EAGG dataset as co-authors. If your project is approved by our committee, we will give you the exact list of people that should be listed in the paper along with the dataset.
