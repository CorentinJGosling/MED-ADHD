# EAGG RCT Dataset Curated at Southampton University (MED-ADHD)

## Description of the database

The MED-EAGG project is a database of 151 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the efficacy/safety of pharmacological interventions for people with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The collection of the data from these RCTS has been performed within the context of a network meta-analysis led by Prof Samuele Cortese (University of Southampton), on the behald of the European ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG).

## Steps for a project using the MED-ADHD dataset

1. Carefully check that the goal of your project does not overlap with a project that has already been submitted by another team (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxnPo9E77LrsMqH3C6ANb3AoaNmDu5NV76WvtY-a0g/edit#gid=0[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxnPo9E77LrsMqH3C6ANb3AoaNmDu5NV76WvtY-a0g/edit#gid=0]). If so, feel free to contact them to propose your help.
2. Read the data dictionnary below and record all the variables of interest.
3. Fullfill a proposal form, which includes a description of the projet, a list of variables you would need, as well as a description of the team behind it (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOku8vVWqndY_6WZ8H2lqbftxBq0EwXcwUWxggRO6ac0RIMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfOku8vVWqndY_6WZ8H2lqbftxBq0EwXcwUWxggRO6ac0RIMQ/viewform?usp=sf_link]) .
4. Wait for the approval of your request by the executive committee.
5. Once approved, you will receive the dataset by encrypted e-mail. You will need a Proton eail account to obtain it (https://proton.me/fr/mail[https://proton.me/fr/mail]).
6. At that time, you will also receive the list of MED-ADHD collaborators that you must include as co-authors of your paper.
7. Analyze the dataset and send us the manuscript describing the results.
8. Publish the manuscript (note that the code used to analyze the data **MUST** be publicly shared, **but that the raw data cannot be shared**).
9. Delete both the dataset we sent you and the email in your ProtonMail mailbox.

## Credits

Each publication on this database should list the key members behind the MED-EAGG project as co-authors. If your project is approved by our committee, we will give you the exact list of people that should be listed in the paper along with the dataset.

## Variables

- Demographics (age, sex, etc.)
- Type of medication and doses
- ADHD core symptoms
- Clinical Global Impression (CGI)
- Acceptability
- Tolerability
- Blood pressure
- Individual side effects

## Aims of the database

The aim of the MED-EAGG projet is to make all the data we collected freely available for the community. We expect that the sharing of these data will rapidly lead to ambitious new projects, which will provide a better understanding of the efficacy/safety of ADHD drugs.

## Before asking for the data

Before reaching us to access the data, you must check that a project similar to the one you are planning is not already underway. To do so, carefully review the list of accepted projects here: -->
