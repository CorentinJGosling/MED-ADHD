# Medication's RCT Dataset Curated at Southampton University (MED-EAGG)

## Description of the database

The MED-EAGG project is a database of 151 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the efficacy/safety of pharmacological interventions for people with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). The collection of the data from these RCTS has been performed within the context of a network meta-analysis led by Prof Samuele Cortese (University of Southampton), on the behald of the European ADHD Guidelines Group (EAGG).

## Aims of the database

The aim of the MED-EAGG projet is to make all the data we collected freely available for the community. We expect that the sharing of these data will rapidly lead to ambitious new projects, which will provide a better understanding of the efficacy/safety of ADHD drugs.

## Before asking for the data

Before reaching us to access the data, you must check that a project similar to the one you are planning is not already underway. To do so, carefully review the list of accepted projects here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxnPo9E77LrsMqH3C6ANb3AoaNmDu5NV76WvtY-a0g/edit#gid=0[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qgxnPo9E77LrsMqH3C6ANb3AoaNmDu5NV76WvtY-a0g/edit#gid=0]

## Access to the data

If the project you are planning is not already underway, to obtain the data, you should describe to our committee the rationale of your project, the variables you would need, and the team that will support the publication of the results. You can retrieve the codes for all the variables that can be requested in the various excel files above, and in the list at the bottom of this page.

To apply for the data, simply fill-in the following google form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hUgmore7yy6_AaSqpuiSP7R0KG3Ve9nD1yyFnIaDBCU/edit[https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hUgmore7yy6_AaSqpuiSP7R0KG3Ve9nD1yyFnIaDBCU/edit]

## Credit

Each publication on this database should list the key members behind the MED-EAGG project as co-authors. If your project is approved by our committee, we will give you the exact list of people that should be listed in the paper along with the dataset.
